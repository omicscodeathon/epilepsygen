# Novel Candidate Genes Identification in Epilepsy Through Integrative Genomic Analysis and Bioinformatics

## Background
Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Despite significant advancements in our understanding of epilepsy pathophysiology, the underlying genetic factors contributing to its development and progression remain incompletely elucidated. Genetic studies have revealed a complex interplay of various genes and molecular pathways, emphasizing the need for comprehensive and integrative approaches to identify novel candidate genes that contribute to epileptogenesis.
The advent of high-throughput genomics technologies has revolutionized our ability to explore the intricate genetic landscape of epilepsy. Integrating diverse genomic datasets, such as gene expression profiles, genetic variants, and epigenetic modifications, can provide a holistic view of the molecular mechanisms underlying this disorder. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis utilizing integrative genomic and bioinformatics methodologies to identify novel candidate genes associated with epilepsy.

## Aim
Identify novel candidate genes associated with epilepsy.
